Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Titan from Sri Lanka, and I'm a software engineer passionate about creating technology to elevate people and build communities. Some technologies I find fulfilling to work with include ReactJS, Scala, Java, and Python. I enjoy both web development and backend development. I have experience in market manipulation algorithm development and automation script development.
